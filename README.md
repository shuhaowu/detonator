Firefox crash stats data exploration/analysis code. This code is not really for
you to use, but more just for it being there for everyone to see.

To run this:

 - Get redis.
 - Get python, numpy, scipy, matplotlib
 - python run.py

It is important to note that some blog posts did not use the code presented 
here to graph those points as the code has gone through rewrites for it to be
cleaner and more capable.
